# Building Data Warehouse for a Clothing Store

In this project, I have developed a comprehensive data architecture for a clothing retail shop LEP which focuses on selling dresses. This project aims to simulate the entire process followed by data-driven companies in making decisions based on data.

The project encompasses various stages, including web scraping, data processing and transformation, database and data warehouse development, and ultimately, data analysis and decision-making.
